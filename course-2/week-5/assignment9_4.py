# 9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and 
# figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
# The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of 
# those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates 
# a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count 
# of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, 
# the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
